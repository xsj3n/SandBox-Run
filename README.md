# SandBox-Run
This was something I threw together because I test app deployments in the windows sandbox a lot currently.

## Pre-requisites
The windows sandbox feature needs to be enabled. 

## Status
Update to win11 sandbox killed this implementation. Pending revamp or deletion. 

## Usage 
./sandbox-run.ps1 -ScriptPath <path_to_script_to_execute_in_vm>
